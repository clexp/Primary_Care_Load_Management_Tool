This is an excellent and thorough summary! You’ve provided all the key information needed to plan a focused, professional, and achievable project. Here’s a structured plan and some recommendations based on your context, goals, and constraints:

---

## 1. **Project Goals & Success Criteria**

- **Primary Goal:** Deliver a usable Streamlit webapp for call center managers to analyze call data and trial staffing scenarios.
- **Secondary Goal:** Produce a 10-minute demo (preferably a video) that demonstrates the app, the development process, and good project/data practices.
- **Success:** The app is intuitive for non-technical users, provides actionable insights, and is robust enough for a live demo.

---

## 2. **User & Data Context**

- **Users:** 1–2 call center managers, low technical expertise.
- **Data:** 15+ months of historical call data (CSV), with potential for more columns and daily updates. No staff roster data yet, but can be added.
- **Security:** No patient data, so minimal risk. NHS internet compatibility required (avoid suspicious packages, keep dependencies minimal, no open ports, etc.).

---

## 3. **Key Features (Prioritized)**

### **Must-Have**

- **Data Upload & Exploration:** Upload CSV, view summary stats, time series, and distributions.
- **Call Volume Prediction:**
  - Classical (means, std dev per day/slot)
  - Prophet-based seasonal prediction (with bank holidays)
- **Scenario Simulation:**
  - Run DES with adjustable parameters (staffing, call duration, etc.)
  - Visualize queue lengths, wait times, abandonment, etc.
- **Usable UI:** Simple, clear navigation and explanations for non-technical users.

### **Nice-to-Have**

- **Bayesian analysis for call volume** (if time allows)
- **Password protection** (basic, if time allows)
- **Scenario comparison/report export** (if time allows)

---

## 4. **Recommended Workflow Structure**

### **A. Data Analysis Workflow**

- Upload and explore historical data
- Generate and visualize call volume predictions (classical & Prophet)
- Export or use predictions as input for simulation

### **B. Scenario Simulation Workflow**

- Set up and run DES scenarios (staffing, call patterns, etc.)
- Visualize and compare outcomes
- Optionally, use predictions from analysis as scenario inputs

_These can be separate pages in Streamlit, with clear navigation and explanations._

## 5. **Development Roadmap (6 Weeks)**

### **Week 1–2: Foundation**

- Set up clean repo, environments, and Streamlit skeleton
- Implement data upload and basic exploration
- Add classical call volume prediction (means/std dev)
- Start collecting screen captures for demo

### **Week 2–3: Prediction & Modeling**

- Integrate Prophet for seasonal prediction (with bank holidays)
- Visualize predictions and allow export to simulation
- Add docstrings and comments (focus on “why”)

### **Week 3–4: Simulation**

- Refine DES model, connect to UI
- Allow user to adjust scenario parameters
- Visualize simulation results (queue, wait, abandonment)
- Validate model with historical data

### **Week 4–5: Usability & Polish**

- Improve UI/UX for non-technical users
- Add tooltips, explanations, and error handling
- Test with real users (call center managers)
- Address feedback, fix bugs

### **Week 5–6: Demo & Final Touches**

- Record demo video (development process, app walkthrough)
- Add any nice-to-haves if time allows (Bayesian, password, etc.)
- Final code cleanup, docstrings, and packaging

---

## 6. **Boundaries & Limits**

- **Scope:** Focus on core workflows; defer advanced features unless time allows.
- **Security:** No patient data, keep dependencies minimal, no open ports.
- **Documentation:** Prioritize docstrings explaining “why”; minimal user docs.
- **Testing:** Parallel with dev, driven by user feedback.
- **Presentation:** Prioritize a smooth, clear demo over feature completeness.

---

## 7. **Next Steps**

1. **Confirm this plan** (or suggest changes)
2. **Set up a project tracker** (Trello, Notion, or even a simple TODO list)
3. **Start with the data upload/exploration page** (if not already done)
4. **Schedule regular check-ins** (weekly or biweekly) to review progress and adjust

### If you’d like, I can:

- Break down the first week’s tasks into actionable steps
- Help you set up a project tracker template
- Draft a checklist for your demo video
- Provide code templates for docstrings and UI explanations

**Let me know how you’d like to proceed, or if you want to adjust any part of this plan!**
