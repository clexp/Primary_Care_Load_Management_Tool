# **Project Brief: Primary Care Load Management Tool**

## **Overview**

The _Primary Care Load Management Tool_ is a decision-support web application designed to help primary care practices manage call volume and staffing efficiently, minimizing patient wait times. This project is being developed in collaboration with a real end user (a call center manager), with the goal of achieving real-customer use. The final tool should be simple, web-accessible, and capable of processing real or synthetic call data to provide actionable insights.

## **Project Objectives**

1. **Deliver a functional tool that provides value to primary care practices.**
2. **Ensure the tool is accessible and user-friendly via a web interface (likely using Streamlit).**
3. **Incorporate relevant data science techniques to meet certification requirements, including discrete event simulation, synthetic data, and predictive modeling.**
4. **Support user data uploads (CSV, with potential Excel support) and generate insights based on historical and projected call volumes.**
5. **Create a scalable and generalizable tool that can be used across multiple primary care practices.**

## **Core Features ("Table Stakes")**

- **Data Input**: Accepts CSV files from phone systems.
- **Quick Insights**: Visualizes call volume trends for immediate overview.
- **Projections & Predictions**: Users can modify key variables (e.g., staffing levels) and see their impact on average wait times.

## **Ideal Accomplishments**

- **Flexible Data Handling**: Accepts CSV files or generates synthetic data if none is available.
- **Expanded Insights**: In addition to wait times, also reports highest wait times and dropped calls.

## **Stretch Goals**

- **Broader Data Support**: Accepts Excel files in addition to CSV.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Bayesian analysis to estimate call demand ranges.
- **Multi-Site Support**: Handles datasets with demographic differences for multi-location practices.

## **Next Steps**

1. Develop a working prototype with basic data visualization and projection functionality.
2. Deploy an early version for user testing and feedback.
3. Iterate based on real-world usage to refine predictions and usability.
4. Expand functionality based on time and feasibility (stretch goals).

This project will also serve as a foundational piece in a broader data science portfolio, demonstrating expertise in applied healthcare analytics.
