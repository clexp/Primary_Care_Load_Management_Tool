    "The `add_seasonality()` method allows us to add custom seasonal patterns to our Prophet model. In our case, we're adding a business hours component because call centers typically have distinct patterns during operating hours versus non-operating hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fourier Order Explained\n",
    "The `fourier_order` parameter (set to 3 in our model) is a crucial component that determines how complex our seasonal pattern can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is Fourier Order?**\n",
    "  - It represents the number of Fourier terms used to model the seasonal pattern\n",
    "  - Higher orders allow for more complex patterns\n",
    "  - Lower orders create smoother, simpler patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Order 3?**\n",
    "  - Order 1: Basic sine wave (too simple for call patterns)\n",
    "  - Order 2: Can capture basic peaks and troughs\n",
    "  - Order 3: Can model more complex patterns like:\n",
    "    - Morning rush\n",
    "    - Lunchtime dip\n",
    "    - Afternoon peak\n",
    "    - End-of-day patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:**\n",
    "  - Higher orders (4+) might overfit to noise in the data\n",
    "  - Lower orders (1-2) might miss important patterns\n",
    "  - Order 3 provides a good balance for call center data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `period` Parameter\n",
    "- Set to 1 in our model\n",
    "- Represents the length of the seasonal pattern in days\n",
    "- For business hours, we use 1 because the pattern repeats daily\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `condition_name` Parameter\n",
    "- Set to 'is_business_hours'\n",

    "- Helps the model distinguish between operating and non-operating hours\n",

    "If the surges before and after holidays are sharp and the trough (holiday) is very deep (zero calls), increasing the Fourier order for the relevant seasonality (e.g., weekly or daily) can help Prophet better fit these abrupt changes. However, be cautious: too high a Fourier order can lead to overfitting or instability, especially with noisy data"
