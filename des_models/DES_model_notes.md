Notes on the DES model:

- The model is a simple call center model that simulates the call center's behavior.
- The model is a discrete event simulation model.
- The model is a queuing model.
- The model is a simulation model.
- The model is a simulation model.

This is for call center queuing models only.

Warm up period does not apply. since the call center is open only for 10 hours.
There is no priority based queuing as this is prior to medical triage.

We probably do need to include unavailability of agents in the model, from sick leave
and other reasons.

Call duration should be modelled with a log normal distribution.
